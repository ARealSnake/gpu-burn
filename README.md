Multi-GPU CUDA stress test

## Build and run

`` Make `` 

`` ./gpu_burn [Burning time]  ``

## Why forking? 

I noticed the original dev of this software was inactive on gitHub and some issues were left opened for months, or years. I forked in an effort to update this tool as much as possible thanks to the community effort.
