# GPU Burn
Multi-GPU CUDA stress test
http://wili.cc/blog/gpu-burn.html

## Build 

```
make
```

## Run

Run with single precision:
```
./gpu_burn [Burning time]
```

Run with double precision:
```
./gpu_burn -d [Burning time]
```

## Why forking? 

I noticed the original dev of this software was inactive on gitHub and some issues were left opened for months, or years. I forked in an effort to update this tool as much as possible thanks to the community effort.
